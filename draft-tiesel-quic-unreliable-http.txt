1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", and
   "MAY" are used in this document.  It's not shouting; when these words
   are capitalized, they have a special meaning as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   HTTP has become part of application protocols used for time critical
   applications like video streaming and back-office ad auctions.  These
   applications might have time constrains that can make retransmissions
   of lost frames useless.  Some of these applications may make use of
   partial delivery of their messages, but reliable, in-order stream
   transmission blocks the deliver of data after a gap in the stream by
   design.

   This draft enables applications to request partial delivery of HTTP
   objects by allowing to selectively disable retransmissions on HTTP
   responses.

3.  General Concept

   This draft specifies a new HTTP header used to request unreliable
   delivery of the HTTP request body.  The server then uses unreliable
   QUIC streams as specified in [I-D.tiesel-unreliable-streams] to
   transfer HTTP request bodies in a potentially unreliable way.  To
   prevent requests entering some kind of zombie state, headers are
   always transferred reliably.

4.  Requesting Unreliable transmission

   By adding the following header, a HTTP client can request unreliable
   transmission of the response body:

   Transport-Response-Reliability: unreliable

   In case unreliable transmission should only be used to prevent
   retransmissions after a certain deadline, the client hat add the
   following header:

   Transport-Response-Reliability: unreliable-after DATE

   Where DATE is either an relative offset in milliseconds or uses the
   format specified in [RFC7231] with optionally extending time-of-day
   to

   time-of-day = hour ":" minute ":" second | hour ":" minute ":" second
   "." msec

   In case of requested having requested unreliable deliver with using
   the "unreliable-after" verb, retransmissions on that stream should be
   stopped after the time specified.

   For unreliable deliver with using the "unreliable" verb, the server
   may use domain knowledge about the data transmitted to decide whether
   to retransmit parts of the data.

5.  Stream Mapping

   As the stream mapping between versions -04 and -05 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-http] changes from separating HTTP header and body
   into different QUIC streams into having HTTP/2 frames of different
   types in one stream, we need different stream mapping for these.

   Note that draft-ietf-quic-http-04 allows much simpler implementation
   as it does not require partial retransmission within an unreliable
   stream.

5.1.  Stream Mapping for draft-ietf-quic-http-04

   The control stream MUST alway use a reliable stream to ease state
   keeping.

   When indicated by the "Transport-Response-Reliability" HTTP header,
   the server SHOULD open the data stream as unreliable stream.

5.2.  Stream Mapping for draft-ietf-quic-http-05-wip

   As prerequisite to requesting unreliable delivery of HTTP objects,
   the client MUST open the new stream as unreliable stream.  The
   "Transport-Response-Reliability" HTTP header sent over reliable
   streams SHOULD be ignored.

   Despite opening the stream as unreliable stream, all HTTP/QUIC frame
   headers as well as the payload of "HEADERS" frames MUST be
   transmitted reliably to ease state keeping.
